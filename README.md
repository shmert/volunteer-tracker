# volunteer-tracker-html

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.11.1.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

This looks at `http://localhost/directory` during development. 

You'll want to use the backdoor to log in, 

`http://localhost/directory/rest/index.php?ssb-backdoor=true`

Then you should be good to go 

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
